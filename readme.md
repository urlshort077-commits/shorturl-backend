## Overview

BytesURL is a full-stack URL shortener platform that enables users to create short links, track detailed analytics, and manage usage through subscription plans.

The backend is built with a modular and scalable architecture using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, with PostgreSQL managed via Prisma ORM. It provides core services such as unique URL generation using nanoid, real-time analytics (device, browser, operating system, geolocation, and referrer), and secure authentication using Firebase.

The system includes role-based access control for administrative operations and integrates Stripe for payment processing and subscription upgrades. AI capabilities are integrated via the Grok API to support backend-driven assistance and intelligent features.

## Notice

The system design diagram below does not include the recently integrated AI components. AI functionality was added after the initial system design and is not reflected in that diagram. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is up to date.
