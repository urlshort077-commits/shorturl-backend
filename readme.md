BytesURL is a full-stack URL shortener platform that allows users to shorten URLs, track click analytics, and manage subscription plans. The backend is built with a modular architecture using Node.js and Express, backed by PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM, and secured with Firebase Authentication.

Key capabilities include real-time click analytics (device, browser, OS, geolocation), role-based access control for admin operations, and Stripe-powered subscription upgrades.
